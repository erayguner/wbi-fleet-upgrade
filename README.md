## Quick Start

**New users**: See the [Quickstart Guide](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wbi-fleet-upgrade.git
cd wbi-fleet-upgrade

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
python3 main.py --help
```

### 2. Authenticate with Google Cloud

```bash
# Login and set default application credentials
gcloud auth application-default login

# Set your project
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Enable required API
gcloud services enable notebooks.googleapis.com
```

### 3. Run Your First Dry-Run

**IMPORTANT**: Always start with a dry-run to see what would happen without making changes.

```bash
# Check what instances need upgrading
python3 main.py \
  --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --locations europe-west2-a \
  --dry-run
```

This will:
- ✅ Scan all instances in the specified location
- ✅ Check which ones need upgrading
- ✅ Show you what would happen
- ✅ **Make NO actual changes**

### 4. Perform Your First Upgrade

After reviewing the dry-run output:

```bash
# Upgrade with automatic rollback protection
python3 main.py \
  --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --locations europe-west2-a \
  --rollback-on-failure
```

## Common Usage Examples

### Upgrade Fleet Across Multiple Locations

```bash
# Dry-run first
python3 main.py \
  --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --locations europe-west2-a europe-west2-b us-central1-a \
  --dry-run

# Execute upgrade
python3 main.py \
  --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --locations europe-west2-a europe-west2-b us-central1-a \
  --rollback-on-failure
```

### Upgrade Single Instance

```bash
python3 main.py \
  --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --locations europe-west2-a \
  --instance my-notebook-instance \
  --rollback-on-failure \
  --verbose
```

### Rollback Recently Upgraded Instance

```bash
# Check rollback eligibility first
python3 main.py \
  --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --locations europe-west2-a \
  --instance my-notebook-instance \
  --rollback \
  --dry-run

# Execute rollback
python3 main.py \
  --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --locations europe-west2-a \
  --instance my-notebook-instance \
  --rollback
```

### Production-Safe Upgrade with All Safety Features

```bash
python3 main.py \
  --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --locations europe-west2-a \
  --max-parallel 5 \
  --rollback-on-failure \
  --health-check-timeout 900 \
  --stagger-delay 5.0 \
  --verbose
```

### Using Bash Wrappers (Environment Variables)

```bash
# Set environment variables
export GCP_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
export LOCATIONS="europe-west2-a europe-west2-b"

# Upgrade (dry-run)
./wb-upgrade.sh --dry-run

# Upgrade (actual)
./wb-upgrade.sh

# Rollback (dry-run)
./wb-rollback.sh --dry-run

## Safety & Best Practices

### Built-in Safety Features

1. **Dry-Run by Default**: Cloud Build defaults to dry-run mode for safety
2. **Health Checks**: Automatic pre and post-operation health validation
3. **Automatic Rollback**: Optional auto-rollback on upgrade failure
4. **State Validation**: Only operates on eligible instances (ACTIVE, ready state)
5. **Pre-Flight Checks**: Comprehensive rollback eligibility validation
6. **API Rate Limiting**: Stagger delay and parallelism controls prevent throttling
7. **Detailed Logging**: Track every operation step with structured logs
8. **JSON Reports**: Machine-readable reports for audit and analysis

### Operational Best Practices

#### Before Any Operation

1. ✅ **Always dry-run first** - Understand impact before making changes
2. ✅ **Start small** - Test with one instance before fleet operations
3. ✅ **Backup critical data** - Ensure important work is saved
4. ✅ **Check maintenance windows** - Schedule during low-usage periods
5. ✅ **Notify stakeholders** - Alert teams of planned operations
6. ✅ **Verify rollback eligibility** - Confirm rollback capability before upgrading

#### During Operations

1. 📊 **Monitor logs actively** - Watch for errors and warnings
2. ⏱️ **Track progress** - Monitor operation duration and success rate
3. 🚨 **Watch for failures** - Be ready to halt operations if issues arise
4. 📱 **Stay available** - Have on-call engineer during critical operations

#### After Operations

1. ✅ **Verify all instances** - Confirm all instances are ACTIVE and healthy
2. 📋 **Review reports** - Check JSON reports for any issues
3. 📝 **Document results** - Record outcomes for audit trail
4. 🔄 **Update procedures** - Improve runbooks based on learnings

### Production Deployment Checklist

## What Happens During an Upgrade

1. **Scan**: Find all instances in specified locations
2. **Pre-Start (Fleet)**: Start all STOPPED/SUSPENDED instances in
   parallel; skip actual start in --dry-run
3. **Check**: Verify each instance is ACTIVE and ready; if
   STOPPED/SUSPENDED and not yet started, the tool will start it
   automatically
4. **Test Upgradeability**: Ask GCP if upgrade is available
5. **Upgrade**: Start the upgrade operation
6. **Monitor**: Poll the operation until complete
7. **Verify**: Check instance is ACTIVE and healthy
8. **Report**: Generate detailed logs and reports

## Rollback Guide

### When You Can Roll Back

Rollback is only available if the instance was upgraded recently and a
valid snapshot/previous version exists. The tool performs pre-checks to
confirm:

- Instance is in ACTIVE state (STOPPED/SUSPENDED instances are started
  in parallel first, unless --dry-run)
- Recent successful upgrade is present in history
- A valid snapshot/rollback target exists
- Rollback timing window is still valid

Use `--rollback --dry-run` to check eligibility safely.

### How Rollback Works

1. **Scan**: Find instances in specified locations (or a single
   instance)
2. **Pre-Start (Fleet)**: Start all STOPPED/SUSPENDED instances in
   parallel prior to eligibility checks; skip actual start in --dry-run
3. **Pre-Checks**: Validate state, upgrade history, snapshot, and
   timing window
4. **Rollback**: Trigger rollback to the previous version
5. **Monitor**: Poll until the operation completes
6. **Verify**: Confirm the instance returns to ACTIVE and is healthy
7. **Report**: Write logs to `workbench-rollback.log` and JSON report
   `rollback-report-*.json`

### Rollback Commands

```bash
# Fleet rollback eligibility (dry run) - shows which
# STOPPED/SUSPENDED instances would be started
python3 main.py --project <project-id> --locations LOCATIONS \
  --rollback --dry-run

# Single instance rollback (auto-start if STOPPED/SUSPENDED)
python3 main.py --project <project-id> --locations LOCATIONS \
  --instance INSTANCE_ID --rollback

# Bash wrapper (with env vars)
export GCP_PROJECT_ID=<project-id>
export LOCATIONS="europe-west2-a europe-west2-b"
./wb-rollback.sh --dry-run
```

### Rollback Troubleshooting

#### Rollback Not Available

```bash
# Check upgrade history for the instance
# Ensure a recent successful upgrade exists
# Confirm snapshot/previous version is available
```

#### Permission Denied

```bash
# Check you're logged in
gcloud auth list

# Check project access
gcloud projects describe PROJECT_ID
```

#### Instance Busy or Not Running

```bash
# Ensure instance is ACTIVE
# Wait for ongoing operations to finish (UPGRADING/STARTING/STOPPING)
```
